## Objectives

* To connect the work from the semester to introduce, motivate, and explain a research project in terms of its scope, feasibility, developed prototype, and preliminary results from run experiments.
* To write a convincing proposal document that showcases the excellence of your project. 

---

## Introduction

Across each of our assignments, we have used reason to explore different aspects of idea development. Each of these assignments had specific objectives:

* __Assignment 1__ (The idea): To determine a fitting idea or area of research in which a project could be completed.

* __Assignment 2__ (The Web Notebook): To learn how to set up a Hugo and Netlify to create a website which will play the part of a research notebook.
* Assignment 4 (The Gap): To contemplate the deliverable of your research project by identifying the knowledge gap motivated by relevant literature. This assignment will invite the student to consider the end-product so as to begin to set goals for a senior thesis research project.

* __Assignment 3__ (The Literature): To learn how to use public online searches to locate and read peer-reviewed articles in the literature to the benefit of a research interest and software tools to help facilitate your research.

* __Assignment 4__ (The See-It-To-Be-It Thesis Exploration): To observe and inspect the comprehensive works of former graduates to determine thesis formatting, writing, section and style for thesis preparation. 

* __Assignment 5__ (The Gap): The determination of the goals of the project in terms of its deliverable and its motivation by the literature. 

* __Assignment 6__ (Project Feasibility): To determine some of the parameters of scope of the project. To explore the available resources at hand (i.e., tools, skills, literature, data, and etc.) which will be applied to the completing of the project. To inquire whether a project can be completed in a given time frame (2-3 months) with the application of the available tools.

* __Assignment 7__ (The Prototype and Experiment): To design and implement a prototype tool that can run experiments, collect data, and analyze results. To write clear documentation, which allows others to use the tool, and to demonstrate the implemented prototype. To design and conduct an experiment using developed prototype to collect preliminary data with a goal of answering at least one research question connected to the research project idea.

* __Assignment 9__ (Post-Experimentation): To determine what was learned from the experiment which could support the general project. To get feedback from peers about the experiment.


* In this assignment, you are to combine the knowledge gained in each of these previous assignments to write a basic draft of your proposal (at least 2000 words) in which you discuss the following main ideas.

## Main Ideas


1. What is the area of your research in your proposed project idea? What is your specific proposed idea and why is it important? Motivate with references as relevant.
2. What is already known in the literature about this problem area; where does your project’s concentration of your own interests lie in this area? What goals have you set for this project? Motivate with references as relevant.
3. What is the Gap between the field and the knowledge of the area? Why is this gap present and what are the implications of the gap and what is your solution to try to bridge this gap? Motivate with references as relevant.
4. Using specifics, what is/are the research question(s) that motivate your research project?
5. Discuss the scope and feasibility of this work. For instance, what are the limits in your area of research? How far do you indent to follow this research question?
6. Discuss the prototype you developed to demonstrate feasibility. Give an overview of its design and implementation. Discuss any data and existing software/libraries/tools that were necessary for the development of your prototype.
7. What evidence is there that the prototype will provide any support for your project? How will your prototype be helpful in the planning, execution and completion of your research project?
8. Discuss the experiment that you performed involving the prototype. What were the hypotheses and research question(s) of your experiment and what steps were taken to respond to them?
9. Discuss the results of the experiment. What was learned from applying these steps which will be helpful to the completion of your project and the achieving the main goals of your research project?
10. How did you explain and visualize your results from your experiment so that they could be understood by those who are not in your field of research? Explain how these visualizations could be used in your research project to help explain its foundations.
11. What ethical concerns are involved with your research? How will you recognize them and how will you handle them once they are apparent?
12. What are the next steps to develop and complete your research project.


### Overview of Tasks

**Commit log**: If your your GitHub commit log does not show continuous progression (no clusters of commits such as during the last few days of the project), then you will receive a full grade reduction for this project.

* **Part 1**; (Today, 20th April 2023 Thursday Class and Lab): Begin planning and then complete and submit the outline for this writing assignment in `writing/outline.md`. At least two GitHub commits must be present at the conclusion of the lab.

* **Part 2**; For class (Tuesday, 25th  April 2023): Peer interviews discussing the questions above to determine how each is addressed in the outline to build a working proposal with a good flow that makes the reading more convenient.
Each interviewer is to submit a GitHub issue to their interviewee’s repository to communicate their suggestions for improvement. Please note, these suggestions are to help ensure clarity and cohesiveness of the proposal document.

* **Part 3**; For class (Thursday, 27th April 2023): Work day to begin (or continue) the writing of `writing/proposal.md` where you follow your outline and perhaps, some of the remarks given to you by your interviewer. At least one additional GitHub commit is required at the conclusion of this class session.

* **Part 4**; For lab (Thursday, 27th April 2023): Work day to complete the writing assignment in `writing/proposal.md`.

* **Part 5**; After Monday 1st May 2023: Create a blog post containing your comprehensive, clear, and coherent story explaining your research project, its motivation, research gap it addresses, prototype, preliminary results through experimentation, ethical considerations of your project, and future work that you would need to complete to bring your project to a conclusion next year.

  + If needed, revisit your prototype work to ensure it is functioning correctly and is properly documented. Your thesis readers next year will review your prototype, experimentation, and the final writing assignment work before beginning their supervision of your project.

  + Web notebook: Please provide a cohesive blog post that includes this writing assignment (min 2000 words). Please title your posting, Research Proposal.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

**Note**: As you work in your writing documents, please be sure to remove the preamble text.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 5%]:**: For the repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Evaluation [up to 10%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the GitHub issue they create in peer's repository reveal a proficiency of technical evaluation of someone else's project. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted GitHub issue should have at least three suggestions for improvement that are relevant and beneficial to the project at hand. Additionally, the GitHub issue should have the correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate suggestions.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 85%]:**: Students receive a grade in accordance with the writing cues presented in the `writing/outline.md` and `writing/proposal.md` documents.The submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.
